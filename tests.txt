This file is a convient way for me to test simple language features and to
document these features. Lines starting with '|' are program source code and
following lines with '>' are the expected output.


It's a stack based language. Operands and operators are pushed on the stack:

| 1
Remaining operands on the stack are outputted:
> 1

| 123
> 123

| -1
> -1

| 1 2
> 1
> 2


Unary and binary operations are evualted on the operands that have most
recently been pushed on the stack. This means that expressions are written in
postfix notation:

| 1 !
> 0

| 2 3 +
| 2 3 -
> 5
> -1

| 2 3 *
| 2 3 /
> 6
> 0

| 2 3 &
| 2 3 |
| 2 3 ^
> 2
> 3
> 1

| 1 dup
> 1
> 1

| 1 2 swap
> 2
> 1
